Getting Started
You need to signup and then you can find your API key under your account, and start using API right away!

Try our weather API by using interactive API Explorer or use Swagger Tool.

We also have SDK for popular framework/languages available on Github for quick integrations.

Want to choose which weather field to return in the API response? Change it from API response fields.

If you find any features missing or have any suggestions, please contact us.

Authentication
API access to the data is protected by an API key. If at anytime, you find the API key has become vulnerable, please regenerate the key using Regenerate button next to the API key.


Authentication to the WeatherAPI.com API is provided by passing your API key as request parameter through an API .

Air Quality Data
Air Quality data is returned in the Forecast API, History API and Realtime API response. Depending upon your subscription plan we provide historical (from 1st March 2021 onwards), current and 3 day air quality data for the given location in json and xml.

It provides air quality index (see below) data on major pollutant gases like Carbon monoxide (CO), Ozone (O3), Nitrogen dioxide (NO2), Sulphur dioxide (SO2), PM 2.5 and PM 10.

By default air quality data is not returned. To get air quality data back in the response from Forecast API, History API and Realtime API, pass the parameter aqi=yes.

co	float	Carbon Monoxide (μg/m3)
o3	float	Ozone (μg/m3)
no2	float	Nitrogen dioxide (μg/m3)
so2	float	Sulphur dioxide (μg/m3)
pm2_5	float	PM2.5 (μg/m3)

Bulk Request
If you are on Pro+, Business or Enterprise plan then you may use our bulk weather option to send multiple locations to get weather for all the locations sent in a single request.

Each location sent in bulk operation is counted as 1 call. It works for all the API methods except Search API.

For bulk you need to pass in the querysting q=bulk and then pass a json body as POST method with utf-8 encoding. All the the other request parameters will be passed as query as usual.

Thanks to Dzebo Elvis for pointing out that the POST method should be used and not GET.

Json format for sending multiple locations in the POST body.

Example
WeatherAPI.com API is so easy to implement. Look at following examples on how you can form a request to get data either through a web browser or in your application.


So to get current weather for London: JSON: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=London

XML: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.xml?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=London
To get 7 day weather for US Zipcode 07112: JSON: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=07112&days=7

XML: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.xml?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=07112&days=7
Search for cities starting with Lond: JSON: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/search.json?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=lond
XML: http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/search.xml?key=<YOUR_API_KEY>&q=lond
Integrations
Please use our API Explorer to see how the request is formed and what response to expect.

With Note API Connector + WeatherAPI, teams can sync real-time conditions, 1–14-day forecasts, and historical weather into Notion to power weather-aware calendars, task checklists, and staffing plans across sites, jobs, or properties. They can also build risk dashboards that surface severe-weather alerts and air-quality data, and generate daily briefings or post-incident reports comparing planned work with observed conditions.

We also have SDK for popular framework/languages available on Github for quick integrations.

Resources
Weather Icons and Codes
In the JSON response we return a condition:code which is a code for describing weather. For example clear, sunny, etc.


You may retrieve the whole condition list as JSON to implement different weather icons or apply other logic to your application. It also includes multi-language translations of weather condition text.


Multilingual Condition list URL: https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/conditions.json


English Condition list URL (CSV): https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/weather_conditions.csv


English Condition list URL (JSON): https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/weather_conditions.json


English Condition list URL (XML): https://www.weatherapi.com/docs/weather_conditions.xml


Please download the list and use it offline instead of directly linking into your application.
